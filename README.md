# 📊 Pandas Mini Project – Student Grades Analysis

This project is a mini case study where I take the role of a **Data Analyst at a university**, analyzing student grades using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. The goal is to clean, process, and extract insights from student performance data, helping inform recommendations for improving outcomes.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files Used

- `roster.csv` – contains student information (NetID, Email, Section)
- `hw_exam_grades.csv` – includes homework and exam scores
- Other support files to match and verify student data

## ✅ What I Did

- Imported and cleaned data from multiple CSV files
- Converted identifiers to lowercase and set appropriate indices
- Removed irrelevant "Submission" columns using lambda functions
- Merged datasets to align grades with student roster
- Handled missing data and inconsistencies
- Analyzed scores for trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Extracted insights such as average grades, high/low performers, etc.

## 📈 Key Learnings

- How to clean and transform raw data using Pandas
- Data merging techniques and index management
- Using lambda functions to filter and reshape DataFrames
- Insight generation through exploratory analysis

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook file in Jupyter:
    ```
    jupyter notebook MiniProject_Pandas_(1)Done.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells step by step to view the data cleaning, transformation, and analysis processes.
